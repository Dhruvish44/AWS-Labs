## üìå Objective
To perform a mock IAM access audit in a simulated AWS environment, identify over-privileged accounts and roles, detect risky access patterns, and enforce least privilege without breaking functionality.

---

## üõ† Tools & Services Used
- **AWS IAM Console** ‚Äì User and role policy review  
- **CloudTrail** ‚Äì Activity logging and anomaly detection  
- **IAM Policy Simulator** ‚Äì Testing and validating policy changes  
- **Visual Studio Code** ‚Äì Editing JSON IAM policies  

---

## üåê Scenario Overview
During a routine IAM audit in a mock AWS environment, I identified the following issues:

1. **User: `devops_temp`**
   - Had full admin access (`"Action": "*", "Resource": "*"`).
   - Risk: Over-privileged for a contractor role.  
   - CloudTrail logs showed **S3:PutObject** actions on a production bucket during off-hours.

2. **Role: `EC2Admin`**
   - Inline policies included full RDS permissions.
   - Risk: Misaligned with job function (role should be limited to EC2 only).

## üîç Findings

| **Entity**   | **Issue**                                   | **Risk Level** | **Evidence**                   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| `devops_temp` | Full `*:*` permissions                      | Critical       | CloudTrail off-hours S3 access |
| `EC2Admin`   | Inline RDS full permissions                 | High           | Role permissions misaligned    |

---

## üõ† Remediation Steps

1. **Restrict Contractor Permissions**  
   Created a custom IAM policy restricting `devops_temp` to S3 access for specific project buckets only.

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": [
           "s3:ListBucket",
           "s3:GetObject",
           "s3:PutObject"
         ],
         "Resource": [
           "arn:aws:s3:::project-data-bucket",
           "arn:aws:s3:::project-data-bucket/*"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

2. Replace Inline RDS Permissions

Removed inline RDS full access from the EC2Admin role and attached the AWS-managed ReadOnlyAccess policy instead.

3. Enforce MFA

Enabled MFA for all IAM users to reduce account takeover risks and strengthen authentication.

‚úÖ Outcome

Reduced attack surface by eliminating unnecessary admin privileges.

Implemented least privilege access aligned with job roles.

Maintained business continuity without breaking functionality.

Improved audit readiness and compliance posture.

üìä Lessons Learned

Contractor accounts should never have wildcard permissions.

Inline policies create policy drift risk ‚Üí prefer managed/custom policies.

CloudTrail is essential for detecting abnormal access behavior.

MFA enforcement should be a baseline requirement.
