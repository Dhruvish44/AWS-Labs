## 📌 Overview
This repository documents my hands-on **AWS security simulations and audits**, converted into structured **whitepapers**.  
Each lab focuses on **Identity & Access Management, Compute, and Networking** — core areas for securing cloud infrastructure.  

The goal: **Proof-of-Work**.  
Instead of “just studying AWS,” I document misconfigurations, security risks, and remediation steps in a professional report format — similar to what SOC Analysts and Cloud Security Engineers deliver in real-world environments.
