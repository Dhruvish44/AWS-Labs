## 📌 Overview  
This repository is a collection of my **hands-on AWS SkillBuilder labs and simulations**, written up as structured **whitepapers**.  

I use AWS **SkillBuilder Builder Labs** to practice real-world scenarios (IAM, S3, VPC, EC2, etc.), then document:  
- ✅ Misconfigurations I discovered  
- ✅ Security risks identified  
- ✅ Remediation steps applied  
- ✅ Final outcomes  

The purpose is **Proof-of-Work** → instead of only earning certifications, I demonstrate **practical skills** through reproducible labs, GitHub writeups, and linked PDFs.

## 🗂 Repository Structure  

- `*_Simulation.md` → My lab writeups in Markdown format  
- `*.pdf` → Original exported lab reports from AWS SkillBuilder  
- Future labs will follow the same pattern for consistency
